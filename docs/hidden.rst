Inline Markup
-------------

Paragraphs contain text and may contain inline markup: *emphasis*, **strong emphasis**, ``inline literals``,
standalone hyperlinks (http://www.python.org), external hyperlinks (Python_), internal cross-references (Title_),
external hyperlinks with embedded URIs (`Python web site <http://www.python.org>`__), footnote references
(manually numbered [1]_, anonymous auto-numbered [#]_, labeled auto-numbered [#label]_, or symbolic [*]_), and
citation references ([12]_). Character-level inline markup is also possible
(although exceedingly ugly!) in *re*\ ``Structured``\ *Text*. Problems are indicated by |problematic|
text (generated by processing errors; this one is intentional).

---------
Footnotes
---------

.. [1] A footnote contains body elements, consistently indented by at
   least 3 spaces.

   This is the footnote's second paragraph.

.. [#label] Footnotes may be numbered, either manually (as in [1]_) or
   automatically using a "#"-prefixed label.  This footnote has a
   label so it can be referred to from multiple places, both as a
   footnote reference ([#label]_) and as a hyperlink reference
   (label_).

.. [#] This footnote is numbered automatically and anonymously using a
   label of "#" only.

.. [*] Footnotes may also use symbols, specified with a "*" label.
   Here's a reference to the next footnote: [*]_.

.. [*] This footnote shows the next symbol in the sequence.

.. [4] Here's an unreferenced footnote, with a reference to a
   nonexistent footnote: [5]_.


---------
Citations
---------

.. [11] This is the citation I made, let's make this extremely long so that we can tell that it doesn't follow the normal responsive table stuff.

.. [12] This citation has some ``code blocks`` in it, maybe some **bold** and
       *italics* too. Heck, lets put a link to a meta citation [13]_ too.

.. [13] This citation will have two backlinks.

Math
----


This is a test. Here is an equation:
:math:`X_{0:5} = (X_0, X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4)`.
Here is another:

.. math::
    :label: This is a label

    \nabla^2 f =
    \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial r}
    \left( r^2 \frac{\partial f}{\partial r} \right) +
    \frac{1}{r^2 \sin \theta} \frac{\partial f}{\partial \theta}
    \left( \sin \theta \, \frac{\partial f}{\partial \theta} \right) +
    \frac{1}{r^2 \sin^2\theta} \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial \phi^2}

You can add a link to equations like the one above :eq:`This is a label` by using ``:eq:``.
